# The World's Best 3D Printed Hex Bit Set Holder

Lots of 4mm hex bits sockets (135!), and it mounts to your Wall Control Pegboard.
## Good
* Easy to print:
  * Generous tolerance and accuracy of +/- 0.5mm (My Prusa MK3S+ prints at +/-0.2mm) 
  * Only 0.8mm of TPU/E required
* Easy to grab individual bits with fingers due to the generous spacing.
* Easy organizations due to the notches in the design.
* Thin profile that mounts flush with Wall control that feels secure.
* Inserted bits feel stable on insert
* Symetry allows easy expansion (unsure what it looks like on a wall control pegboard)

## How you can improve this
* Change the holes from hex to circles. It’ll be faster to print, and a reasonable improvement on usability. 
  * Background: I orginally envisioned that a bit would stay in place due to the shape of it. This unfortunately doesn’t work with wide tolerances and hard plastic. The TPU + glue layer is a bandaid that uses friction to grab the bits, but this now makes the alignment requirement between bit and hole a nuisance. 
* Change the size of it so multiple holders can slot into each other on a wall control pegboard. This design most likely produces gaps due to where the mount is placed.
* Parametric variable inputs: 
  * Bit spacing ~= Finger thickness + wiggle room.
  * Size: 
    * This most likely doesn’t fit neatly together on a wall control board, so this will need to be updated.
    * People have different sized drawers / places that they’ll want to dump this into.
* Redesign this for a single material: it’ll be faster, cheaper, more durable, and no glue.
  * If using rubber: TPU/E can probaby be half as thick; but if it’s too shallow, it may not “feel” right, regardless of the physics.
  * Complaince mechanisms: It’ll be great if each bit can click in and out. Try to keep the tolerances to be at least twice worse than what you can print at so others can have simliar success.
